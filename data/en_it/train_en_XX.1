The top three nations in the medal table remained the same as the previous edition: the Soviet Union won 66 gold medals and a total of 188 medals, the United States was a close runner-up with 60 gold medals and 161 medals overall, while East Germany was a distant third with 11 golds. The games' motto was "Uniting the World's Best", and a total of 2,312 athletes from 54 countries engaged in the 17-day program of 21 sports. Each countries' contingent of athletes did not parade separately at the opening ceremony, but instead all athletes entered the stadium as one large mass (emphasizing the theme of international unity). The size of the sporting program meant that some events were held in other Washington cities, including Tacoma, Spokane, and the Tri-Cities area. A number of venues in the region were built or renovated for the Games: Federal Way gained an aquatics venue (King County Aquatic Center) through the games, while Seattle itself gained a new track for Husky Stadium and new flooring for the Edmundson Pavilion. The Seattle Space Needle had a large purpose-built gold medal hung around the structure during the Games. The competition featured a significant cultural aspect compared to the previous edition. Around 1,400 Soviet athletes went to the US and stayed with host families in Seattle. Soviet cosmonauts also visited schools in the city and the Moscow State Circus gave a number of performances. A Goodwill Games Arts Festival was held in conjunction with the sporting event – 1,300 artists took part in the festival, which featured a performance by the Bolshoi Ballet, a museum exhibition of Soviet history, and a 2 million-dollar stage production of Leo Tolstoy's "War and Peace". Similarly to the 1986 Goodwill Games, the 1990 edition of the event was not financially successful and Ted Turner personally lost $44 million as a result. Two world records were broken during the Games: the 200-meter breaststroke mark was topped by all three medalists in the race, with American Mike Barrowman improving the record to two minutes and 11.53 seconds. Soviet athlete Nadezhda Ryashkina completed a world record of 41:56.21 in the 10 km race walk.

It was Indonesia's fourth time to host the Southeast Asian Games, and its first since 1997. Previously, Indonesia also hosted in 1979 and 1987. The capital city of Jakarta hosted all three of the previous Games prior to this. Palembang became the third SEA Games non-capital host city, after Chiang Mai (1995) and Nakhon Ratchasima (2007), both in Thailand. Around 4,965 athletes from 11 participating nations participated at the games which featured 545 events in 42 sports. The games was held from 11 to 22 November 2011, although several events had commenced from 3 November 2011. The games was opened by Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the President of Indonesia at the Gelora Sriwijaya Stadium in Palembang. The final medal tally was led by host Indonesia, followed by Thailand and Vietnam, while Timor-Leste won its first ever Southeast Asian Games gold medal. Several Games and national records were broken during the games. Although there were several controversies, the Games were deemed generally successful with its promotion for conservative effort on endangered fauna species namely the komodo dragon through the mascot and with the rising standard of competition amongst the Southeast Asian nations.

It was hosted by Katy Perry. The 34th annual award show aired live from the venue for the second time in its history. The music video for Taylor Swift's song "Look What You Made Me Do" premiered during the broadcast. Lil Yachty co-hosted the pre-show with Terrence J, Charlamagne Tha God, and MTV News' Gaby Wilson, while Gabbie Hanna hosted backstage for the show. It was broadcast across various Viacom networks and their related apps. Compared to the previous year, viewership was down from 6.5 million to 5.68 million viewers, making it the lowest viewed show since 1994. A combination of having to compete with the season finale of HBO's "Game of Thrones", which drew over 12.07 million viewers, and the ability to now stream the award show online is said to account for the drop in viewership.

He was able to rejoin the track and claimed his third victory of the season, and a record seventh premier class victory at Assen. Rossi finished ahead of Márquez, while teammate Jorge Lorenzo completed the podium; Rossi extended his championship lead to 10 points as a result.

A presidential election was held in São Tomé and Príncipe in 2011, the first round beginning on 17 July 2011 with a run-off held on 7 August 2011. Incumbent President Fradique de Menezes has served the maximum two terms and could not constitutionally seek a third term. The final result saw former president Manuel Pinto da Costa, aged 74, elected in a narrow victory against Speaker of Parliament Evaristo Carvalho. The first round was contested by approximately 120 candidates. The candidate from President de Menezes' party, Force for Change Democratic Movement–Liberal Party (, MDFM–PL), was Delfim Neves, who jointly represented the MDFM–PL and his own Democratic Convergence Party (, PCD–GR). Pinto da Costa, who ran independently, won the most votes but failed to receive the majority required to claim an outright victory. Carvalho, of the ruling party Independent Democratic Action (, ADI), a former prime minister and the incumbent Speaker of the National Assembly, placed second. A run-off to be contested between Pinto da Costa and Carvalho was announced on the same day. Pinto da Costa received the backing of the majority of eliminated candidates, and he was expected to win comfortably. Pinto da Costa won the runoff, held 7 August, by five percentage points. He is scheduled to take office on 3 September and remain as president for a term of five years.

The 2015 Czech Republic motorcycle Grand Prix was the eleventh round of the 2015 MotoGP season. It was held at the Masaryk Circuit in Brno on 16 August 2015. In the premier class, Jorge Lorenzo took his second pole position of the season and ultimately his fifth win of the season, ahead of Marc Márquez and Valentino Rossi. Andrea Iannone finished fourth, while fifth place was contested by Andrea Dovizioso and Dani Pedrosa, with Pedrosa ultimately coming out on top by 0.075 seconds. Cal Crutchlow, Maverick Viñales, Alex de Angelis, and Eugene Laverty all crashed out of the race before the halfway mark. With these results, Lorenzo's win gave him the championship lead over Rossi, by virtue of more wins at that point. In the junior classes, Moto2 championship leader Johann Zarco extended his lead in the championship, winning ahead of Esteve Rabat and Álex Rins. In a restarted Moto3 race, Gresini Racing rider Niccolò Antonelli took his first victory ahead of Enea Bastianini and Brad Binder, with the top nine riders being split by 1.42 seconds at the finish.

Parliamentary elections were held in Moldova on 5 April 2009. The Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova (PCRM) won a majority of seats (60 out of 101) for the third consecutive occasion. Turnout was 59%, exceeding the 50% necessary for the election to be valid. Following the elections, Parliament was required to elect a new President of Moldova as the incumbent Vladimir Voronin had to stand down after completing two terms. Presidential elections required the winning candidate to receive at least 61 votes, but the opposition parties refused to vote for the three PCRM-nominated candidates in three rounds of voting between May and June 2009, meaning no president was elected. As a result, early parliamentary elections were held in July.

The show took place on May 19, 1991 and was held at the Bayfront Arena in St. Petersburg, Florida. The main event of the show was a match between then reigning WCW World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair and the NWA World Heavyweight Champion Tatsumi Fujinami with both world championships on the line. In the United States the match was promoted as simply being for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, not promoting the fact that Fujinami had defeated Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in March 1991. The undercard saw Bobby Eaton win the WCW World Television Championship from Arn Anderson while The Steiner Brothers defended the WCW World Tag Team Championship. In the opening match, The Fabulous Freebirds won the vacant WCW United States Tag Team Championship. The show consisted of twelve matches, with some of the matches being edited out of the official VHS tape release of the show. The event also featured the television debut of Johnny B. Badd. In 2015, all WCW pay-per-views were made available on the WWE Network.

The 1975 World Ice Hockey Championships were the 42nd Ice Hockey World Championships and the 53rd European Championships of ice hockey. The tournament took place in West Germany from 3 April to 19 April and the games were played in Munich and Düsseldorf. Six teams took part in the main tournament, each playing each other twice. The Soviet Union won all of their games, and became World Champions for the fourteenth time, and won their 17th European title. This year did not offer much in the way of drama, with the expected order of finish happening again, and the host not even playing in the top level tournament. This helped to change the player eligibility rules and change the format. Finland narrowly missed a medal again, finishing fourth for the sixth straight year.

General elections were held in Denmark on 5 June 2019 to elect all 179 members of the Folketing; 175 in Denmark proper, two in the Faroe Islands and two in Greenland. The elections took place ten days after the European Parliament elections. The elections resulted in a victory for the "red bloc", comprising parties that supported the Social Democrats' leader Mette Frederiksen as candidate for Prime Minister. The "red bloc", consisting of the Social Democrats, the Social Liberals, Socialist People's Party, the Red–Green Alliance, the Faroese Social Democratic Party and the Greenlandic Siumut, won 93 of the 179 seats, securing a parliamentary majority. Meanwhile, the incumbent governing coalition, consisting of Venstre, the Liberal Alliance and the Conservative People's Party whilst receiving outside parliamentary support from the Danish People's Party and Nunatta Qitornai, was reduced to 76 seats (including the Venstre-affiliated Union Party in the Faroe Islands). On 6 June, incumbent Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen of the centre-right liberal Venstre party tendered his resignation, and Federiksen was tasked with forming a new government. On 25 June, Frederiksen reached an agreement with the red block, and on 27 June she was appointed Prime Minister and her government, a single-party Social Democratic government, took office.

In 1929, elections were held to the Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union. The elections were noteworthy for their rowdiness and elements of political opposition. Within the Communist Party, the Left Opposition attempted to run rival candidates against the officially nominated Communist candidates, while outside the party the Russian Orthodox Church attempted to create an organized opposition with religious candidates. Kulaks, Tolstoyans, and Baptists also were active in illicit anti-Communist electoral campaigning. Peasants demanded the creation of "peasant unions" on an equal footing with urban trade unions, and urban workers complained that Communist officials had become a new privileged class. Ethnic strife and the Soviet government's financial support of Comintern were also issues raised against the official candidates. Marches in opposition to the official candidates were held and in some areas in the provinces Communist officials were physically attacked. However, in the actual elections the communist candidates won a large majority and the opposition forces did not make any headway.

The 1927 Far Eastern Championship Games was the eighth edition of the regional multi-sport event, contested between China, Japan and the Philippines, and was held from 28–31 August 1927 in Shanghai, Republic of China. A total of eight sports were contested during the four-day competition. This was the last time the competition was held on a biennial schedule and the event subsequently changed to a quadrennial basis, being held in the even years between Olympic competitions. Women athletes appeared at the games. A demonstration volleyball match was held by an Eastern Chinese women's team. However, their appearance generated a negative reaction from some audience members, who began insulting and shouting at the women. The match was curtailed before the allotted time as a result. The football match between China and the Philippines caused further disruption as the two teams began brawling and the audience threw objects onto the pitch – some leaving the stands to join the melee. This soured relations among the delegations and at the post-games banquet, in response to loud antics of Filipino attendees, the Chinese head organiser, Shen Siliang, openly stated that Chinese and Japanese women should avoid the Filipino delegation. In the football competition, China was represented by South China AA, a Hong Kong-based team.

The 1978 U.S. Pro Tennis Championships was a men's tennis tournament played on outdoor green clay courts (Har-Tru) at the Longwood Cricket Club in Boston, USA. The event was part of the 1978 Grand Prix circuit. It was the 51st edition of the tournament and was held from August 21 through August 28, 1978. Despite pressure to switch to a hard court surface from the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and some leading players, in line with the surface change made that year by the US Open which directly followed the Boston event, the tournament organization elected to remain a clay court tournament in 1978. Several top players including Björn Borg, Guillermo Vilas and Jimmy Connors elected not to play the tournament. Fourth-seeded and defending champion Manuel Orantes won the singles title and the accompanying $32,000 first-prize money. The final was delayed until Tuesday, August 29 due to rain.

The Social Democratic Alliance and the Left-Green Movement, which formed the outgoing coalition government under Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, both made gains and formed an overall majority of seats in the Althing (Iceland's parliament).

The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela held presidential elections on 3 December 2006, to choose a president for the six-year term to begin on 10 January 2007. The contest was between incumbent President Hugo Chávez, and Zulia Governor Manuel Rosales of the opposition party UNT. After handily winning a recall referendum in 2004, President Chávez positioned himself for re-election in 2006 for a second full term. The opposition did not hold a primary, instead, the candidates reached a consensus into backing the governor of the largest state (Zulia), Manuel Rosales. Chávez benefited from a high popularity, and led most opinion polls throughout the campaign. He went to win re-election by the widest margin by percentage of the popular vote since the 1947 election; and by the largest margin of votes cast in the history of Venezuela. Chávez would eventually win another term 6 years later, before dying only a month into that term.

Former army officer and left-wing politician Ollanta Humala narrowly defeated Keiko Fujimori, daughter of imprisoned former President Alberto Fujimori.

General elections were held in Sweden on 16 September 1973. The Social Democratic remained the largest party, winning 156 of the 350 seats. For most of the campaign, the opposition parties had led the socialist parties in the polls. It has been speculated that several events influenced the outcome of the election in favour of the government: the death of King Gustaf VI Adolf the previous day, the Norrmalmstorg robbery and the 1973 Chilean coup d'état. Palme had delivered an impassioned speech on Salvador Allende's legacy on the eve of the election, in which he praised the democratic system. The election instead produced a draw, with the socialist and liberal-conservative blocs each winning 175 seats. Since the opposition could not pass a motion of no confidence against Palme's government, he was able to remain in power. In order to pass legislation the Social Democrats had to draw lots or seek support from the opposition. To prevent this scenario from reoccurring, the number of seats in the Riksdag was adjusted to an odd number for subsequent elections.
